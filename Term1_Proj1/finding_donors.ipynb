    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "1. Gaussian Naive Bayes:\n",
    "    1. **Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Naive Bayes has opportunity for application in text classification, as was seen during the quiz in this section.  As an example besides spam classification, Naive Bayes can be used for sentiment detection, for instance determining whether a written review was positive or negative in connotation.  By creating a training set from existing data, such as restaurant reviews, NB can be trained to predict whether a review is positive or negative for supplying general meta-data to prospective visitors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. **What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Naive Bayes classifiers work well when the features used for predictions can be assumed to be independent.  Though this is rarely true in the real world, making the assumption often proves to be reasonable, and suprising performance can be achieved.  The reason that the assumption can be often made when it is known to not hold is because the algorithm's classification quality actually depends on how the dependence between two attributes is distributed between different classes.  Since the Naive Bayes only has to select the classification that has the maximum probability, the full impacts of interdependence between features can be cancelled out.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    In addition, for problems where there is little available training data, Naive Bayes still functions well as it requires comparatively little data, and is a fast algorithm.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. **What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?**\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Naive Bayes is a good classifier, but poor estimator.  As stated [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html), it cannot predict continuous variables or probability distributions across all possible classifications.  If the problem called for a prediction of the actual income, this algorithm would not be as suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?**\n",
    "        \n",
    "    I chose Naive Bayes for this problem because the classification only requires that the algorithm predict whether or not a person's income is above a threshold, not precisely what the income is.  In addition, I believe there are obvious interdependencies on the different fields, and I want to see how the algorithm is affected by these dependencies.  For instance, I believe age and relationship status likely have cross dependencies, and I want to see how the naive assumption that these are independent performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. AdaBoost\n",
    "    1. **Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    As seen [here](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/PatternRecognition/slides/churn_adaboost.pdf), Adaboost was used for predicting whether customers at a bank were going to cease doing business with the bank.  The prediction is important because it allows the bank to focus more on those customers and offer attractive opportunities in order to reain the customer.  In this paper, very similar methods of processing and one hot encoding are performed and decision stumps are used as the weak learners.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. **What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The model is useful because it can be applied with various types of weak learners methodically in order to produce improved results over any of the individual weak learners.  Therefore, the weak learners do not need to perform excellently, they only need to be slightly better than random.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. **What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Adaboost struggles with noisy data and outliers because as those outliers are missed their weight increases and the algorithm places increasing weight in order to classify it correctly, thus sacrificing the performance on the overall set of data. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. **What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    I selected this model because it can be tuned with a number of weak learners and depth to the decision trees used in order to ensure that it isnt overfit to the data.  In addition, it is a popular classification algorithm that I wanted to learn more about.  Given that I plan to use single level decision trees, I will be able to inspect each weight to understand the magnitude of each feature and understand which specific features are contributing the most signficantly to the overall classification.\n",

    "    SVMs have been used [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5822181/) for classifying microarray gene expression data as to whether cancer is present.  SVMs were useful because of the high dimensionality of the problem (many gene features) and the small training set size.

    "    It seems that SVM's place high burden on the engineer to tune C and gamma parameters carefully in order to avoid overfitting or underfitting data.  In situations where data is very noisy, it can be difficult to select a gamma value for an RBF kernel which does not overfit data.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    As was seen with capital gains and losses, there will be outliers in the data which may or may not be sufficiently accomodated through logarithmic and normalization transformations.  The SVM should allow for tuning of the C and gamma parameters in order to reject these outliers to have a simplified model that generalizes nicer and has less complexity."

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    "   - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!"

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this application, the AdaBoost classifier appears to be the optimal choice and worth spending addition time in tuning.  Though both AdaBoost and SVM performed similarly in terms of accuracy on the full training set, the data only had 24% of the actual records as having income >50K.  Therefore accuracy would be a misleading statistic as a naive algorithm always predicting that everyone makes <= 50K would be correct 76% of the time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With the current F score with beta 0.5, the metric emphasizes precision over recall.  What this means is that the current F score metric rewards the model which has few false positives in predicting whether someone makes >50K\n",
    "per year over prioritizing few false negatives.  This inherantly means that a beta value 0.5 assumes that CharityML would be more accepting of requesting less money from those that make >50K (False negative), and less accepting of requesting more money from those that make <=50K (false positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be a reasonable approach given that lower income people may find higher requests for funds audacious or entitled on the part of CharityML.  This impacts the reputation of CharityML and wastes effort in fundraising.  Alternatively it makes sense that CharityML be more accepting of requesting less money from people with >50K, as this is a conservative approach where the prospective donator may view the request as modest on the part of CharityML."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The AdaBoost model works by effectively employing many advisors that are experts on certain fields or features of the data.  For instance, imagine that CharityML has one analyst that can predict income with a precision, accuracy, and recall slightly better random using only the age of a person.  This individual doesn't need to perform excellently on their own, but they do need to identify which persons were not correctly classified based on their prediction.  CharityML then finds an expert in another feature, such as Occupation type, and ensures that that expert's model classifies those which were previously misclassified are properly classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "CharityML takes these multiple simple experts who are each trying to improve on each other, and combines their opinions into a better estimate based on a voting scheme.  An expert has more say in the vote when they are able to correctly classify people who were previously misclassified, while also correctly classifying a significant portion of the others as well.  In the end, the predictions can be suprisingly accurate."

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that sex, education level, occupation, hours per week, and race will be significant features required for the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Occupation** - I believe a majority of records earn most of their income from their occupation, not from capital gains, therefore I believe the type of work a person does will most typically show their income.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Education Level** - As related to occupation, education level serves often in society as a filter for high paying occupations.  Many who do not complete a minimum bachelors education do not have access to more knowledge driven lucrative fields.  This will not be a perfect feature however, because there are many that work significant overtime hours in lesser skilled occupations and can make a significant amount of money. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Sex** - Sex is a known bias in pay equity as has been proven by [many studies](https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-wage-pay-gap-charts-2017-3#the-gender-wage-gap-varies-widely-depending-on-the-state-1).  I expect that women will make less than men and that this is a relevant feature for our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Race** - Similar to sex, race can be correlated with other pay equity biases.  A relevant study can be found [here](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/) by the Pew Research Institution.  This correlation means that I expect there to be a significant predictive potential in the race feature from this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Hours Per week** - I believe this will be an import predictor because for non-salaried workers, hours per week worked will correlate directly with pay.  Therefore it would be expected that for people working more than a typical 40 hour work week, they have higher potential to make >50K, while people less than 40 hours per week may be more likely to make <=50K."

    "* If you were close to the same answer, how does this visualization confirm your thoughts? \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I was suprised to find that only one out of the five features selected by RandomForestClassifier were the same.  I predicted hours per week would be a weak indication compared to other features, but it actually ended up being the second most import feature behind age.  Suprisingly, age is weighted more than twice the next leading feature, hours-per-week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age should have been an obviously relevant feature as people typically complete higher levels of education and gain more experience as they age.  I perceived a trend where over the last 20-30 years more people are going to school for a longer period of time when they're young.  I thought this would offset the experience aspect of older people who may have less relevant modern day skills.  As determined by the RandomForestClassifier feature importance, my assumption proved false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital gain is relevant to income level as it essentially is a subset of the person's total income.  Therefore if someone made capital gains of $5000, their income would only need to be $45,000 to be classified as >50K.  Essentially, people with higher capital gains have an offset to their income.\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel that education_num is a similar statistic compared to education level (which I predicted would be important), as someone who is in school longer probably has achieved a higher level of education.  Therefore I assume that these are similarly weighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a person being a married spouse is a significant indicator which I didn't expect.  I believe that non-married people would be more likely to make more money, as they can more readily devote significant time to their career.  I believed that by devoting more time to their career, they would likely have higher income.  Perhaps whether someone is a spouse is highly correlated to their age and thus correlates to the data in the same way that age does."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The final model on a lesser feature set shows that the accuracy and F-score does suffer slightly.  Accuracy is reduced by 2%, but is still much better than the ~24% that comes from the naive assumption.  Overall, if training time were of serious concern, this would be a reasonable approach to the model.  However, I cannot set how training time would be a constraint for CharityML, as this type of training census data would probably not be continually released and there would not be a need for frequent retraining "
